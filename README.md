 ## Overview

FLIGHT-FARE PREDICTION For a traveller it is important to know the fare value of a trip, and as prices of flight ticket varies abruptly and it becomes hectic for a user to check different websites, use different deals. A flight fare prediction model will help inform the travellers with the optimal time to buy their flight tickets and understand ‚Ä¶


## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10.6. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
python app.py
```

##  Dataset Description
- The Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh
- We will be using two datasets ‚Äî Train data and Test data.
- Training data is combination of both categorical and numerical also we can see some special character also being used because of which we have to do data Transformation on it before applying it to our model.
- 1. Size of training set: 10684 records
  2. Size of test set: 2672 records

## Future Scope
* Use multiple Algorithms
* Front-End
